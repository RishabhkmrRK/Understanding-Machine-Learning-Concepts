1. [SVM Implementation](https://github.com/RishabhkmrRK/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Concepts/blob/main/scikit-learn-svm-understanding-the-concept.ipynb)

In this notebook, I implemented SVM (Support Vector Machine) model on 'Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster' using Scikit learn SVM llibrary (sklearn.svm). The goal was to achieve as accurate as possible SVM model by hypertuning the parameters of different types of model within SVM library.
