# Understanding-the-Concept

This Repository contains the codes of files which help me understand the respective machine learning concepts

1. [EDA commands](https://github.com/RishabhkmrRK/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Concepts/blob/main/basic-eda-commands-for-beginners.ipynb)<br />
  Exploratory Data Analysis commands use in detail analysis and getting overview of dataset. 

2. [SVM Implementation](https://github.com/RishabhkmrRK/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Concepts/blob/main/scikit-learn-svm-understanding-the-concept.ipynb)<br />
  In this notebook, I implemented SVM (Support Vector Machine) model on 'Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster' using Scikit learn SVM llibrary (sklearn.svm). The
  goal was to achieve as accurate as possible SVM model by hypertuning the parameters of different types of model within SVM library.
